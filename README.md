# Tree Devourer GMNG (Fixed!) 
The goal of this MOD is to update the Tree Devourer to have proper (logical) settings. This mod has two settings that would make it "unreal" - a capacity of 50kL, and running around _without_ a spout. Instead, the mod was built where a capacity of 50kL didn't cost anything, and the "spout" was the "unreal" setting... in my mind _teleporting_ the contents from something on the front of your tractor to the trailer on the back is quite unrealistic, where as blowing them there via a directional spout feels more realistic. So, I fixed it. You're welcome.

- This is an extented MOD of the Tree Devourer by raulycristi1 [VSR Modding Sur].
- The original mod is available on ModHub (https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=us&mod_id=260505&title=fs2022)

Both mods `FS22_Tree_Devourer.zip` & `FS22_Tree_Devourer_GMNG.zip` are required.

## Installation Instructions
1. Download this package from GitHub on the releases page, save the [`FS22_Tree_Devourer_GMNG.zip` ] into your mod folder.
2. Download the original mod from ModHub, and put the zip [`FS22_Tree_Devourer.zip`] in your mod folder.
4. Launch the game, when selecting mods for use - if you only want the FIXED version, only check that mod. Checking the original mod is not required for the FIXED to work - the original mod just needs to be in your mod folder, but doesn't need to be checked as one of your active mods when choosing mods.
5. Purchase the item in game as normal, with logical settings, and use as you would expect.
